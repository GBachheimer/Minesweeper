Minesweeper is a puzzle video game first created in the 1960s. The game, generally played on Personal Computer features a table 
of spaces to click. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, 
with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. When selecting a space, it will either show that 
there are no nearby bombs, the amount of mines that are adjacent to the square or that the player has hit a mine, and lost the game.
